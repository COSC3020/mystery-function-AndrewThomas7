### The Short Answer
-In short this function does one simple thing, it takes an array as a parameter and finds the largest element of the said array. This works not just for numbers but for the char and string data type too. Although strings appear to be done lexicographically

### The Long Answer(*The nitty gritty*)
If we take a purely algorithimic approach to whats happening in this function it becomes slightly more complicated. The first thing to notice is that this is a recursive function, aka a function that calls itself, this will be very insightful to how this function preforms its operation.

1.) Firstly we check to see of the array only has a single element, in this case our single element is the largest number because its the only number and we simply return the first and only item in the array (Base Case).

2.) If our first check fails then we create a new variable called foo. Foo is made up of a recursive stack. The function mystery is called again, however it is partitioned such that we remove the first element and keep the rest so for example if we had a=[1,2,3,4], after calling mystery again and using the slice function we have [2,3,4], this continues into [3,4], then [4]. At this point we have one element again and then because this satisfies the first condition 4 is returned and that last stack is closed.

3.) We know move to the third line of code and check 4 against the first element of a=[3,4], because we are still two stacks into recursion. 4 ends up being bigger so it is returned again and then this process repeats comparing for a=[2,3,4] and a=[1,2,3,4]. Upon the last stack closing we will do one last compare and ultimatly 4 is returned.

 This beautiful process works for any position in the array and seemingly for any array of a reasonable size
